## QUESTIONS:
-  how the images are loaded in the NN?  like in the matrices form or in the form of pixels?
- If the images are loaded in the form of pixels then how the pixels are converted to the matrices form?
- how the images are loaded in the NN?
- how the pixels are converted to the matrices form?
- how to define the i/p & o/p shape of the image?
- how to define the number of classes in the image?
- is the  number of classes in the image is equal to the number of neurons in the output layer?
- how to define the number of neurons in the i/p & output layer?

- how to define the padding size?
- how to define the stride size?
- how to define the kernel size?
- 

max and min convolutional layers how they are decided?
max and min value of kernles?
so after sumation of dot products in 1st kernle are these values then used in 2nd?
when feeding images does it matter if the images have different sizes

in pooling are the max/avg value schosen from the kerenl values?
